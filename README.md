# Oleksandr Matvieiev

## 🚀 AI Engineer, Creator of RUFI and Developer of AI Workbench

Hi! I’m Oleksandr Matvieiev — a developer, visionary, and creator of unique tools for interacting with AI. I don’t just integrate GPT — I build **architectures where AI becomes an active agent**, assistant, protector, and even co-author. My mission is to make AI practically useful, safe, and truly intelligent.

## 🔹 My Projects

### 🔎 **AI Workbench**

A unique AI platform where:

* **A neural network controls GPT**, not the other way around;
* Commands go through filtering, classification, and logical reflection;
* GPT is used not for chatting, but as an analytical and generative tool;
* The system is built on **DPA (Distributed Processing Agents)** architecture;
* All actions are logged, tested in a sandbox, and only then executed.

### 🔍 **RUFI OS (Responsive Unified Functional Intelligence)** *(in development)*

A real-time AI core with:

* Embedded legal logic (crime recognition);
* Emergency reaction, logging, and video capture;
* Designed for smart homes, cars, and secure environments.

### ⚖️ **RUFI LegalBot** *(in development)*

A Ukrainian-language legal bot:

* Generates official legal documents;
* Analyzes and qualifies cases under Ukrainian and EU law;
* Capable of participating in e-court proceedings.
